  ## Description
  By the time Bruce Zimmmermann returned to the Oriole Park mound for Sunday’s second inning, the Orioles’ best-laid pitching plans had already been undone. Monday’s off-day loomed on the horizon temptingly, like a faraway refuge. Yet when Zimmermann walked off 5 2/3 innings later, he did so to a standing ovation from the sellout crowd of 11,070, having stabilized Baltimore’s slapdash pitching staff’s shakiest week yet.

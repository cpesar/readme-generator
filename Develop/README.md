  ## Description
  This is a content management system (CMS), application where developers can publish their blog posts and leave comments on other developers posts. Similar to a Wordpress site but specifically for developers. This application follows the Model View Controller paradigm. It uses Handlebars.js as the template languauge, Sequelize as the ORM, and express-session npm for authentication. This app is solely for developers so that they can publish articles, blog posts, as well as thoughts and opinions. I have deployed the application to Heroku and provided a link to the live app below.
